    "# Data Collection\n",
    "The data used for this project consist of news article descriptions from various sources around the world. To get these data, we can make use of the excellent [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org) API, which happens to be very simple to use. On the newsapi homepage, one will see a \"GET API KEY\" in the upper right-hand corner. After clicking this link, you'll be asked to proved an email address and a password...and that's all there is to it! Well, almost. You'll be presented with something called an \"API key\", which is a long series of numbers and letters. This is sort of like a password, and is unique to each individual user. To try the API, simply type:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://newsapi.org/v1/articles?source={NEWSSOURCE}&apiKey={APIKEY}\n",
    "\n",
    "in the search bar. Before doing so, however, replace {APIKEY} with your own API key, and replace {NEWSSOURCE} with a news source like Bloomberg. So our link would then become something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://newsapi.org/v1/articles?source=bloomberg&apiKey=633qw20c29984ce08504f5c89c2cmm02\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in the above example, that particular API key does not work, but is just used to demonstrate how this would be done in practice. The output looks something like this:"

    "One of the great things about newsapi is that this sort of data can be collected from over 70 news sources and blogs from various parts of the world, some of which are not even in english. In order to fetch data like we've done above for many news sources, we need a way to automate the process. In general, the tasks we need to perform are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Loop over a bunch of new sources (e.g., Bloomberg, New York Times, etc.).\n",
    "* For each news source, grab the top, latest, and popular articles.\n",
    "* Get information from each article regarding title, description, url, etc.\n",
    "* Save this data to a csv file for easy reading later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, I wrote a Python module called scrapeNews.py to automatically perform the tasks listed above. I should note that Ahmed Besbes' [data science blog](http://ahmedbesbes.com) was an outstanding source of information for how to do this."

One will notice though that the number of news articles scraped after this run is only on the order of a few hundred or so $-$ not nearly enough for our purposes.

    "# $n$-Gram Analysis\n",
    "The method of $n$-gram analysis is one of the most common types of topic modeling techniques employed today. By $n$-gram analysis, I mean examining combinations of $n$ sequential words in a sentence. For example, the 1-grams (called unigrams) and 2-grams (called bigrams) of the sentence *\"this is an example of a sentence\"* would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unigrams: this, is, an, example, of, a, sentence\n",
    "* Bigrams: this is, is an, an example, example of, of a, a sentence\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first case, the unigrams are just a list of all single words in the sentence. In the second case, the bigrams are all sequential two-word combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "By looking at which $n$-grams occur most frequently in a document, we can get a sense for what is being talked about. In python, the $n$-grams can be computed in two ways $-$ manually using a function that we define ourselves, or automatically using Python Learn's CountVectorizer method. Let's try both!\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the $n$-grams can be computed, we first have to process the text a little bit to remove puctuation and stop words. Stop words are words that occur so frequently in normal speech that they're of little interest to us. These include words like \"the\", \"and\", etc. We can define two functions below to perform these tasks $-$ they're called processText and rmStopwords. A third function called nGrams takes in some text, tokenizes it (i.e., splits it into its individual words) and finds the $n$ sequential word combinations. In this manual implementation, we can also perform an additional task that is helpful in identifying interesting words. If we're finding unigrams, the function tags the part of speech of each word and keeps only nouns, which are more likely to be the subject of a piece of text."

The idea is to find nouns and surrounding descriptive words in the text, as these phrases often carry the main point (i.e., the topic) of a sentence.

          "Author summary It has been unclear how this ability evolves over a person’s lifetime and it had not been possible to be assessed with previous classical tools for statistical randomness. To better understand how age impacts behavior, we have assessed more than 3,400 people aged 4 to 91 years old. Each participant performed a series of online tasks that assessed their ability to behave randomly. The five tasks included listing the hypothetical results of a series of 12 coin flips so that they would “look random to somebody else,” guessing which card would appear when selected from a randomly shuffled deck, and listing the hypothetical results of 10 rolls of a die. We analyzed the participants’ choices according to their algorithmic randomness, which is based on the idea that patterns that are more random are harder to encode in a short computer program. After controlling for characteristics such as gender, language, and education. We have found that age was the only factor that affected the ability to behave randomly. This ability peaked at age 25, on average, and declined from then on. We also demonstrate that a relatively short list of choices, say 10 hypothetical coin flips, can be used to reliably gauge randomness of human behavior. A similar approach could be then used to study potential connections between the ability to behave randomly, cognitive decline, neurodegenerative diseases and abilities such as human creativity.",

To better understand how age impacts behavior, we have assessed more than 3,400 people aged 4 to 91 years old. Each participant performed a series of online tasks that assessed their ability to behave randomly. The five tasks included listing the hypothetical results of a series of 12 coin flips so that they would \\u201clook random to somebody else,\\u201d guessing which card would appear when selected from a randomly shuffled deck, and listing the hypothetical results of 10 rolls of a die. We analyzed the participants\\u2019 choices according to their algorithmic randomness, which is based on the idea that patterns that are more random are harder to encode in a short computer program. After controlling for characteristics such as gender, language, and education. We have found that age was the only factor that affected the ability to behave randomly. This ability peaked at age 25, on average, and declined from then on. We also demonstrate that a relatively short list of choices, say 10 hypothetical coin flips, can be used to reliably gauge randomness of human behavior. A similar approach could be then used to study potential connections between the ability to behave randomly, cognitive decline, neurodegenerative diseases and abilities such as human creativity.\", \"Google announced today that it\\u2019s acquiring Owlchemy Labs, the VR-focused studio that created Job Simulator and Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality.

To better understand how age impacts behavior, we have assessed more than 3,400 people aged 4 to 91 years old. Each participant performed a series of online tasks that assessed their ability to behave randomly. The five tasks included listing the hypothetical results of a series of 12 coin flips so that they would \\u201clook random to somebody else,\\u201d guessing which card would appear when selected from a randomly shuffled deck, and listing the hypothetical results of 10 rolls of a die. We analyzed the participants\\u2019 choices according to their algorithmic randomness, which is based on the idea that patterns that are more random are harder to encode in a short computer program. After controlling for characteristics such as gender, language, and education. We have found that age was the only factor that affected the ability to behave randomly. This ability peaked at age 25, on average, and declined from then on. We also demonstrate that a relatively short list of choices, say 10 hypothetical coin flips, can be used to reliably gauge randomness of human behavior. A similar approach could be then used to study potential connections between the ability to behave randomly, cognitive decline, neurodegenerative diseases and abilities such as human creativity.\", \"Google announced today that it\\u2019s acquiring Owlchemy Labs, the VR-focused studio that created Job Simulator and Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality.

          "Author summary It has been unclear how this ability evolves over a person’s lifetime and it had not been possible to be assessed with previous classical tools for statistical randomness. To better understand how age impacts behavior, we have assessed more than 3,400 people aged 4 to 91 years old. Each participant performed a series of online tasks that assessed their ability to behave randomly. The five tasks included listing the hypothetical results of a series of 12 coin flips so that they would “look random to somebody else,” guessing which card would appear when selected from a randomly shuffled deck, and listing the hypothetical results of 10 rolls of a die. We analyzed the participants’ choices according to their algorithmic randomness, which is based on the idea that patterns that are more random are harder to encode in a short computer program. After controlling for characteristics such as gender, language, and education. We have found that age was the only factor that affected the ability to behave randomly. This ability peaked at age 25, on average, and declined from then on. We also demonstrate that a relatively short list of choices, say 10 hypothetical coin flips, can be used to reliably gauge randomness of human behavior. A similar approach could be then used to study potential connections between the ability to behave randomly, cognitive decline, neurodegenerative diseases and abilities such as human creativity.",

To better understand how age impacts behavior, we have assessed more than 3,400 people aged 4 to 91 years old. Each participant performed a series of online tasks that assessed their ability to behave randomly. The five tasks included listing the hypothetical results of a series of 12 coin flips so that they would \\u201clook random to somebody else,\\u201d guessing which card would appear when selected from a randomly shuffled deck, and listing the hypothetical results of 10 rolls of a die. We analyzed the participants\\u2019 choices according to their algorithmic randomness, which is based on the idea that patterns that are more random are harder to encode in a short computer program. After controlling for characteristics such as gender, language, and education. We have found that age was the only factor that affected the ability to behave randomly. This ability peaked at age 25, on average, and declined from then on. We also demonstrate that a relatively short list of choices, say 10 hypothetical coin flips, can be used to reliably gauge randomness of human behavior. A similar approach could be then used to study potential connections between the ability to behave randomly, cognitive decline, neurodegenerative diseases and abilities such as human creativity.\", \"Google announced today that it\\u2019s acquiring Owlchemy Labs, the VR-focused studio that created Job Simulator and Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality.

To better understand how age impacts behavior, we have assessed more than 3,400 people aged 4 to 91 years old. Each participant performed a series of online tasks that assessed their ability to behave randomly. The five tasks included listing the hypothetical results of a series of 12 coin flips so that they would \\u201clook random to somebody else,\\u201d guessing which card would appear when selected from a randomly shuffled deck, and listing the hypothetical results of 10 rolls of a die. We analyzed the participants\\u2019 choices according to their algorithmic randomness, which is based on the idea that patterns that are more random are harder to encode in a short computer program. After controlling for characteristics such as gender, language, and education. We have found that age was the only factor that affected the ability to behave randomly. This ability peaked at age 25, on average, and declined from then on. We also demonstrate that a relatively short list of choices, say 10 hypothetical coin flips, can be used to reliably gauge randomness of human behavior. A similar approach could be then used to study potential connections between the ability to behave randomly, cognitive decline, neurodegenerative diseases and abilities such as human creativity.\", \"Google announced today that it\\u2019s acquiring Owlchemy Labs, the VR-focused studio that created Job Simulator and Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality.
